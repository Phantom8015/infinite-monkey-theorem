# Infinite Monkey Theorem Generator

This is a Node.js application that simulates the Infinite Monkey Theorem by generating random characters indefinitely. The Infinite Monkey Theorem suggests that if you gave an infinite number of monkeys typewriters, they would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare by randomly typing characters. This program aims to prove this theorem by generating random characters as long as it is kept running.

## Usage

To use the Infinite Monkey Theorem Generator, simply download the program and run it on your computer using Node.js. The program will start generating random characters and printing them to the console window. 

Steps:

1. Open CMD or Terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the program using the `cd` command
3. Run the program using the `node .` command

Easy enough, right?

You can stop the program at any time by using the appropriate key combination for your operating system (for example, "Ctrl + C" on Windows or "Command + C" on Mac). When you restart the program, it will start generating random characters from where it left off.

## Requirements

The Infinite Monkey Theorem Generator was written in Node.js and requires no external libraries or dependencies. It should be compatible with any modern operating system that can run Node.js.
